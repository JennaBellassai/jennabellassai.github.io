The novel’s protagonist, Niru, is a Harvard-bound high school senior in Washington D.C. whose conservative Nigerian father finds out Niru is gay after discovering Grindr installed on Niru’s phone. Niru’s father is furious and forces him to return to his home in Nigeria to attend prayer services to cure his homosexuality and then to meet regularly with a pastor in D.C. While dealing with his aggressive father, Niru is also navigating a friendship with a girl who is in love with him and finishing his senior year as a track star. This book is a heart-wrenching account of what it means to be one’s true self when that self, to some, is unacceptable.</p><p>Experiencing the story from Niru’s perspective, the reader gets to observe just how difficult it is for him to continue to placate his father by “praying the gay away” while he knows his attraction to men will not change. Iweala creates some beautifully painful moments when Niru prays to God to take away the desire he feels because such guilt has been instilled in him. When Niru has a relationship with a college student he meets named Damien, Damien is hurt about Niru’s internalized homophobia: “I won’t be nobody’s sickness,” he says. Iweala’s portrait of Niru is carefully nuanced so that the reader sees just how difficult it is to be in his position.</p><p>One of the most striking parts of this book is the passage when Niru visits his father’s home in Nigeria. Niru’s father is an interesting character—a hypermasculine CEO who worked his way up to provide for his family. Whenever Niru’s father visits Nigeria, he makes sure to bring home all kinds of luxury goods and make sure everyone knows how successful his sons are. There is one scene where a group of boys clean Niru’s father’s house, and Niru reflects on how he could be just like them had his parents stayed in Nigeria, but instead he has the problems of an American teenager and cannot relate. Learning about Niru’s father’s past helped to develop his character, and though his actions toward Niru are repugnant, Iweala’s characterization of Niru’s father explains where his aggression is rooted. The visit to Nigeria also provides deeper context around Niru’s family’s comfortable life in Washington D.C.</p><p>Another character with impressive depth in this novel is Niru’s friend Meredith. They have been friends for a long time, and though she loves him, he is not attracted to her. Niru reveals his sexuality to Meredith at the very beginning of the book, and she is the one who installs Grindr on his phone. Niru and Meredith’s friendship is tested throughout the book as Niru grows distant and Meredith starts to get attention from other guys. I didn’t find Meredith very interesting at the beginning of the book, but she, too, becomes one of its most intriguing characters.</p><p>If you choose to read this book, I would advise you to stick with it, even if it takes a little while for the story to get going. The characters gain considerable depth as the story progresses. Iweala does not shy away from addressing themes like covert racism, police brutality, and toxic masculinity, and he crafts Niru’s experience with such care that parts of this book will bring you to tears. <em>Speak No Evil</em> is breathtaking, and I would recommend it.</p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"during-times-of-distress-i-always-return-to-mary-oliver.","data":{"title":{"text":"Contemplating collective grief through the essays of Mary Oliver"},"date":"27.08.2020","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"book-summary-app-blinkist-wants-to-address-the-market","data":{"title":{"text":"No time to read in a pandemic?
