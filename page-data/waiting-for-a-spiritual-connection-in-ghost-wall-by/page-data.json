The novel is short enough to read in one sitting, and although I had some expectations that weren’t quite met, there was enough tension to keep me glued to the page the whole way through.</p><p>My main gripe with the plot is a detail on the book jacket that had me anticipating a surreal twist: “The ancients built ghost walls to ward off enemy invaders, rude barricades of stakes topped with ancestral skulls. When the group builds one of their own, they find a spiritual connection to the past.” I feel like I spent most of the book anticipating that “spiritual connection.” I suppose I misinterpreted this description, since what transpires did not fulfill my expectation. The actual building of the ghost wall occurs quite late in the plot, so I kept wondering when it was going to happen and when the surreal aspect I expected would come to fruition. </p><p>I suspect that I would have a deeper appreciation for this book if I were more familiar with the history of the ancient Britons. In the same way that protagonist Silvie does not hold the Britons of the Iron Age in the same regard as her history buff father, I fear that I cannot comprehend the historical allusion occuring this book as well as a hypothetical reader well-versed in the historical context would comprehend it.</p><p>The aspect of this book that is more interesting to me is the family dynamic present among Silvie, her exhausted mother, and her abusive father. Silvie’s father’s behavior is more or less repugnant the entire way through, and at times I found it hard to believe that the professor on the trip allowed his behavior to continue. Hearing the book from Silvie’s perspective helps the reader to understand the circumstances under which her family exists and how her father’s abuse can continue under those circumstances. </p><p>I find the class dynamic between the family and the students quite compelling. For the professor and his undergraduates, the camping trip is a leisurely excursion that happens to be part of their course curriculum. For Silvie’s father, the trip is a chance to live out his historical fantasies, and it requires him to use all the vacation time he receives as a bus driver. At times throughout the story, Silvie resents the undergraduates for having never traveled north and for judging her family’s accents. The dynamics among the group get interesting when these tensions come to the surface.</p><p>Ghost Wall is worth a read if you’re looking for something quick and immersive. Despite the fact that I spent the whole book waiting for the “spiritual connection” to be opened, I found it hard to put the book down. The interpersonal tension in the group and Silvie’s struggle against her abusive father were engaging enough to hold my attention.</p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"asbestos-projects-in-the-philadelphia-school-district","data":{"title":{"text":"Asbestos Projects in the Philadelphia School District: A Closer Look"},"date":"23.01.2022","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"for-center-city-chess-fans-rittenhouse-square-is-the","data":{"title":{"text":"For Center City chess fans, Rittenhouse Square is the place to play"},"date":"29.09.2021","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"uid":"waiting-for-a-spiritual-connection-in-ghost-wall-by"}},"staticQueryHashes":["23265376","3257754404"]}
