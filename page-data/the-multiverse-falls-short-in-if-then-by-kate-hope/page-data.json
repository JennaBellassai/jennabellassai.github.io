The premise of a group of neighbors starting to have visions of a parallel universe was exciting, and the characters were interesting. The tension never lets up from the first page onward. However, I was surprised that the whole multiverse thing didn’t play a bigger role, and the explanation we get for it at the end falls short. While Day is an accomplished storyteller who creates characters full of depth, the details of the multiverse in <em>If, Then</em> felt half-baked.</p><p>One of my favorite things about this book was the depth and intrigue of its characters. I feel like I needed barely any exposition before I felt invested in these characters’ stories. I loved hearing about Ginny’s work as a surgeon and following Cass’s journey as a new mother who put her PhD on hold. Mark’s plea to the ecology department at his university for funding for his project studying animal behavior as a predictor of natural disaster is compelling, and it’s easy to root for him as he begins his doomsday prep. I feel like Samara didn’t have as prominent of a role as the other three neighbors, but it was still heart-wrenching to observe her grieve the death of her mother.</p><p>I was surprised at how long it took for the neighbors to band together. I had expected them to bond from their shared experience of glimpsing other realities, but it’s not until very late in the novel that all four characters appear in the same scene. Even then, the characters never share with each other the strange experiences they’ve had, which I thought was odd given the circumstances.</p><p>I thought that the question of why the characters were experiencing these visions was responsible for driving much of the tension in the novel, yet that tension never seems to get resolved. We get to see that Cass is writing her theory of the multiverse, yet we get very few details about what it actually entails. I thought that the tension held up beautifully just about the whole way through this book, but it felt like a let-down when we didn’t get an explanation for the strange occurrences.</p><p>One aspect of this book that’s incredibly disappointing is that later in the book, the universes begin to overlap, but instead of marveling at how details from different visions come together, you are flipping backwards in the book wondering if you misinterpreted something earlier. I think this is a phenomenal concept that could be done to great effect, but unfortunately, I don’t think Day committed enough to this idea for it to land correctly. I don’t want to give too much away, but suffice it to say that at one point I wondered if a plot point hadn’t been edited correctly since it made so little sense (yikes).</p><p>The characters’ visions of parallel universes were almost a side effect of the plot rather than the main event. The character development and internal struggles of the four main characters are compelling enough that the fact that they’re glimpsing other dimensions along the way is less central to the novel than I expected. I was so enraptured by the problems of Ginny and Mark’s marriage and Cass’s struggle to resume her scholarship that I think the book could have been successful without the supernatural element. </p><p>Just because the book’s plot didn’t meet all my expectations doesn’t mean it wasn’t a good read. On the contrary, having finished <em>If, Then</em>, I’m wondering if I put too much stock in my own preconceived notions of how a book will unfold. Even though we don’t get all the answers, we do get an intimate view of a pivotal period in these characters’ lives. Day takes that idea of wondering what would have happened if you did something differently and explores how one would cope if those hypotheticals began to play out before their eyes in real time with the option they chose instead.</p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"how-is-the-pandemic-changing-how-we-think-about-business","data":{"title":{"text":"How is the pandemic changing how we think about business recovery from disasters?"},"date":"26.08.2022","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"exploring-u.s.-college-graduation-rate-statistics","data":{"title":{"text":"Exploring U.S. College Graduation Rate Statistics"},"date":"18.07.2022","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"uid":"the-multiverse-falls-short-in-if-then-by-kate-hope"}},"staticQueryHashes":["23265376","3257754404"]}
