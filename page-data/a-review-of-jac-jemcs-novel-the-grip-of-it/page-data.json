I must say that the plot seems quite archetypal from the outset. However, to discount this novel due to a plot that appears tired at the beginning would be a disservice. Jemc uses horror tropes to her advantage, gradually twisting them so they evolve into something entirely new, drawing you into a unique, terrifying world when you least expect it.</p><p>Couple James and Julie buy a house in a small town from a seedy realtor and quickly find issues with their new home. There’s a stain in the basement that hints at water damage. There’s a constant, low humming sound with no discernible source. There are other things that start happening that you may have seen before if you’ve seen a haunted house film or read a haunted house novel. However, Jemc is too clever to create the same story you’ve heard before. The way that she seamlessly weaves the eerie phenomena of the house into the fabric of James and Julie’s relationship is what kept me reading this novel late into the night.</p><p>The horror of the novel is as much about James and Julie having to admit to themselves that they are seeing things as it is about the unsettling things they see. As the two of them struggle to make sense of what is happening, their relationship suffers. Neither of them wants to scare the other, and neither of them wants the other to think they’ve lost their mind. When it becomes apparent that both of them are having unexplainable experiences in the house, they begin to lose trust in each other and in their own perception. I think it’s brilliant that you can’t really tell if the psychological symptoms James and Julie experience are a supernatural effect of the house or if their mental trauma from losing faith in what is real is actually plausible.</p><p>One horror trope that Jemc employs to great effect is the idea of uncanny doubles. The couple’s elderly neighbor Rolf and his house next door serve as an example of this. At one point, James and Julie are disturbed to realize their neighbor has come into their house without permission. Later, James and Julie find themselves absentmindedly entering Rolf’s house by mistake instead of their own without even noticing at first. Rolf’s house is filthy, and Julie’s coworker Connie remarks on how disgusting Jame’s and Julie’s house is when she visits. As I read, I wondered if it was possible that there was only one house.</p><p>It’s as if Jemc is putting up metaphorical mirrors everywhere. Rolf’s house mirrors James and Julie’s house. James and Julie mirror each other to some extent, and eventually they each split into two versions of themselves, vacillating back and forth between these versions. The house is full of strange compartments and hidden rooms that disappear as soon as they appear. The space between the house and the woods behind it sometimes appears vast and at other times appears minuscule. The way Jemc unsettles your sense of physical space mirrors how she unsettles the characters’ psychological spaces.</p><p>This book gives just enough explanation for the mysterious phenomena to keep your attention but not so much explanation that there’s no room for your own interpretation. Jemc floats clues here and there for you to grasp; you gradually find out the story of the family who lived in the house before Julie and James, but the family history alone is not sufficient to explain the horrors as might be the case in other horror stories. I wasn’t accustomed to this level of ambiguity, and I kept expecting a big reveal. If you like your horrific tales with an all-encompassing explanation for what transpires, you may be disappointed. However, I would encourage you to give this style a chance, as there’s something extra unnerving about not knowing where the haunted house ends and the characters’ minds begin.</p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"consumerism-is-why-youll-never-be-satisfied-with-your","data":{"title":{"text":"Consumerism is why you'll never be satisfied with your Animal Crossing island"},"date":"11.04.2020","categories":[{"category":null}]}},{"uid":"a-review-of-susan-chois-novel-trust-exercise","data":{"title":{"text":"The Staged Dilemma of Real and Imagined in Susan Choi's Trust Exercise"},"date":"15.09.2019","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Reviews"}}]}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"uid":"a-review-of-jac-jemcs-novel-the-grip-of-it"}}}
