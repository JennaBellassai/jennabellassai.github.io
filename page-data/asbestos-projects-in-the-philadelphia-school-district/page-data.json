The dashboard shows the number of asbestos abatement projects at school buildings in the district since 2016. For more information about the dashboard, see <a  href=\"https://controller.phila.gov/city-controllers-office-releases-dashboard-on-school-district-asbestos-projects/\">this press release</a> from the Office of the Controller and the dashboard&#39;s <a  href=\"https://controller.phila.gov/philadelphia-audits/interactive-asbestos-dashboard/#/about\">About page</a>.</p><p>The presence of asbestos in Philadelphia School District buildings has been a topic of concern in recent years. Lea DiRusso, a teacher who taught in the district for twenty-eight years, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2019, <a  href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/education/a/philadelphia-schools-asbestos-problems-lea-dirusso-lawsuit-20200508.html\">reported the Inquirer</a> in May 2020. The story claims that nine schools closed in the district because of asbestos exposure between the time of DiRusso’s diagnosis and the time of reporting.</p><p>In a <a  href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/inq/asbestos-testing-mesothelioma-cancer-philadelphia-schools-toxic-city-20180510.html#loaded\">2018 investigation</a>, reporters from the Inquirer tested surfaces in Philadelphia schools and found alarming levels of asbestos. At the time, the district claimed that the Inquirer’s testing methods deviated from the industry standard and regulations at the local, state, and federal level.</p><p>Teachers at Julia R. Masterman school <a  href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/masterman-teachers-and-parents-at-odds-with-district-over-asbestos-fears/\">protested</a> in August of 2021, holding their professional development day outside, due to concerns about asbestos in the building.</p><p>As the City Controller’s dashboard demonstrates, the number of asbestos abatement projects since 2016 varies by school. When examining this dashboard, I wondered just how much asbestos was slated to be removed in these projects, as well as whether the amount of asbestos to be abated in each school correlated with the district’s budget allocation to the school or the percentage of economically disadvantaged students at the school.</p><p>All of the data manipulation logic to produce the csv’s underlying these visualizations can be found in <a  href=\"https://github.com/JennaBellassai/asbestos-abatement-in-philadelphia-schools\">this GitHub repository</a>.
