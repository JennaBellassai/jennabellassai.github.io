What if instead of carving out the five hours I’d need to get through a nonfiction book, I instead shaved off a few minutes here and there to finish a fifteen-minute summary?</p><p>The concept of reading succinct summaries instead of dense full-length texts is the idea behind Blinkist, a paid app where you can read unlimited summary versions of bestselling nonfiction books for a monthly fee. Gone is the stressful experience of choosing a nonfiction book and carving out the time to work through it, claims their marketing copy. Instead, all you need is a smartphone and a commute that’s at least fifteen minutes—or, since we’re in a pandemic, perhaps a fifteen-minute bathroom break while you hide from your children.</p><p>Blinkist was founded in 2012 on the idea that plenty of people have every intention of reading nonfiction, but a lack of free time and the paralysis of not being able to choose which book to read prevents them from doing so. “Almost none of us have the time to read everything we’d like to read,” Blinkist’s website proclaims. “Yet we lose countless hours to activities that bring us little joy such as commuting, chores and staring at our phones. What if we could turn these little blocks of unallocated time into precious and rewarding moments for learning and reflection?”</p><p>That marketing copy makes clear that Blinkist’s aim is to help you transform time that would otherwise be squandered in your day-to-day to moments of self-improvement, a quest with which overworked knowledge workers in the U.S. are <a  href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/15/improving-ourselves-to-death\">all too familiar</a>. In recent months, various publications have churned out a <a  href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/productivity-coronavirus-pandemic-projects/2020/04/06/742edf54-76e4-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html\">slew</a> <a  href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/productivity-in-coronavirus-lockdown\">of</a> <a  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/style/productivity-coronavirus.html\">articles</a> all seeking to reassure frazzled upper class nonessential workers that it’s okay not to be productive during a pandemic. However, as we approach the sixth month of coronavirus precautions in the United States, while Congress has yet to unveil a new unemployment relief package, anxiety looms about how long a lapse in productivity will <em>continue</em> to be okay.</p><p>Public health crises aside, privileged professionals face constant pressure to be productive, and that pressure spills over from work hours into our personal lives. In our capitalist culture of hyperproductivity, any moment one spends on a banal task seems like a moment wasted, whether or not that moment occurs during work hours.</p><p><a  href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/blinkist-raises-18-8m-for-its-condensed-reading-platform-for-non-fiction-books/\">Techcrunch quoted</a> Blinkist founder Holger Seim in 2018: “The U.S. is obsessed with self-help and self-improvement. Our US tag line [sic] is, “the smarter you is only 15 minutes away.” Seim recognizes that we have an endless need to optimize ourselves, but we have no time to do it. </p><p>We want to better ourselves, and we face constant pressure to do so from our employers and the media, but our lives move at such a breakneck speed that the time investment required to do something like finishing a whole book seems too costly. Enter Blinkist, whose site happens to feature a whole category of books about increasing one’s productivity.</p><p>My employer started offering Blinkist subscriptions as a perk to all employees earlier this year. Intrigued, I signed up for an account and searched for a book called <em>Primed to Perform</em>: <em>How to Build the Highest Performing Cultures Through the Science of Total Motivation. </em>After taking five minutes to read the nine “Blinks” that make up Blinkist’s summary, I was bewildered and suspicious. Did reading that mean I had “finished” the book? Was that summary really a suitable proxy for all three hundred and sixty-eight pages of the hardcover edition?</p><p>Blinkist’s claim to address the market of harried knowledge workers who want to read but have no time to do so resonated to the tune of $18.8 million when the start-up <a  href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/blinkist-raises-18-8m-for-its-condensed-reading-platform-for-non-fiction-books/\">raised its Series C funding round</a> in June of 2018. They charge $16 per month or $99 for a year membership. If you sign up for the monthly membership, the cost over the course of the year would be around the cost of buying twelve e-books or six hardcover books. There’s no limit to the number of summaries you can read on the platform, so it would seem that you’re really getting the bang for your buck (if, that is, you consider the summaries to be adequate approximations of their full-length counterparts).</p><p>What about copyright infringement? Blinkist’s summaries aren’t written by the authors who wrote the books, they’re written by other writers Blinkist hires. Is selling bite-size summaries of books without compensating their authors even legal? It turns out that yes, it is.</p><p>Blinkist addresses this concern directly <a  href=\"https://support.blinkist.com/hc/en-us/articles/218524377-What-about-copyrights-Are-you-stealing-from-authors-\">on their support page</a>: “Our books-in-blinks distill the main ideas and most important concepts from nonfiction books, but they are new, original works of their own, written in our Blinkist style, voice, and format.” They skirt around the dangerous territory of copyright infringement since the summaries on their platform are original works in the eyes of the law. Blinkist also partners directly with some publishers, <a  href=\"https://www.blinkist.com/en/publishers\">claiming</a> that reading Blinkist summaries could lead users to ultimately buy the books.</p><p>Blinkist’s reception from readers is mixed. <a  href=\"https://medium.com/@thetopessentials/blinkist-review-2020-the-best-option-for-reading-and-listening-to-books-on-the-go-8cbab3d7579\">One reader in favor of Blinkist</a> recognizes that the platform is not for everyone: “Blinkist works best for those looking to understand ONLY the critical points made in the book.” <a  href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2018/dec/09/blink-and-youll-miss-it-can-you-really-digest-a-whole-book-in-15-minutes\">A scathing critique in The Guardian</a> laments, “The whole exercise made me question the point of reading.” <a  href=\"https://bookriot.com/blinkist-review/\">A Book Riot review</a> acknowledges Blinkist’s strengths and limitations: “If what you are seeking is a quick way to understand the broad concepts of a current, buzzy nonfiction title, it would probably serve you quite well. But if you actually want to read these titles for the pure enjoyment of absorbing knowledge, Blinkist is not going to deliver that.”</p><p>The potential for Blinkist’s market to usurp the market for books is unclear. <a  href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/blinkist-raises-18-8m-for-its-condensed-reading-platform-for-non-fiction-books/\">Seim insisted in 2018</a>, “We don’t want to replace books. We are creating a market that didn’t exist and expanding one that did.”</p><p>Blinkist’s claim that reading a fifteen-minute summary nets you the same knowledge as reading a book that would take hours is up for debate. When you read a set of Blinks, you have to take a leap of faith—you have to trust that the summary is an accurate portrayal of the book as a whole. I struggled to trust the writer of the <em>Primed to Perform</em> summary, instead wishing I had a copy of the book handy to fact-check for myself, which would defeat the purpose of the summary altogether. </p><p>If you can’t make that leap, instead of reveling in the vast knowledge you gained in such a short time, you’ll be too distracted by what got lost in translation to absorb anything. After all, when you blink, you’re sure to miss some things.</p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"consumerism-is-why-youll-never-be-satisfied-with-your","data":{"title":{"text":"Consumerism is why you'll never be satisfied with your Animal Crossing island"},"date":"11.04.2020","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"a-review-of-susan-chois-novel-trust-exercise","data":{"title":{"text":"The Staged Dilemma of Real and Imagined in Susan Choi's Trust Exercise"},"date":"15.09.2019","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Reviews"}}]}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"uid":"book-summary-app-blinkist-wants-to-address-the-market"}}}
