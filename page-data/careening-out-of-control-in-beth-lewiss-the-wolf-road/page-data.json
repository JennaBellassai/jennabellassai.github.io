Throughout the protagonist’s journey through the wilderness, the tension driving the book forward remains ever present. Main character Elka runs away from a pseudo-adoptive home when she finds out the man she lives with, Trapper, is a serial killer, and he wants to kill her for accidentally leading law enforcement to his door. From the beginning, Elka is always being pursued, and the tension builds as it remains apparent that her pursuer is gaining on her. Lewis craftily sneaks in other sources of tension as the book continues, and there is never a dull moment in <em>The Wolf Road</em>.</p><p>An additional triumph of this book is its narration. Elka’s narration in dialect takes some getting used to, and throughout the book I found myself marveling at Lewis’s adherence to it. Elka’s upbringing permeates her metaphors and moral musings as well as her day-to-day narration. As far as factors that influenced me to continue reading this book, the driving tension wins first place, but Elka’s narration is a close second. I got attached to this protagonist partially because her way of communicating. At times, it’s hilarious, like when Elka has just pushed a man overboard on a boat and sums it up as “Colby gone swimmin’.” She describes the gruesome sound of moving a body as “a wet slapping sound like flogging a bag a’ eels.” Elka is also inclined to wax poetic, however: “We live in a world a’ men and there ain’t no good come out of tellin’ them they monsters. Makes ‘em think they ain’t done nothin’ wrong, that it’s their nature and they can’t do nothin’ to change that.” </p><p>I couldn’t decide how I felt about Elka’s frequent moral musings. At the beginning of the novel, I thought it was clever how Elka seemed to be parroting the things Trapper had told her to the reader, such that the reader could understand how everything Trapper said was truth to her. As the novel progressed, I became a little wary of this line of commentary. I wondered if the reader could do without Elka’s nudges that seemed to say this theme is important, pay attention to it. These were the only times the narration faltered, when Elka pointed something out seemingly only for the reader’s sake and not her own.</p><p>That’s not to say that Elka’s character development isn’t compelling. While the first half of the novel is great and satisfied my itch for a wilderness tale, there is a turning point after which every aspect of the book ramps up and improves. At this turning point, I couldn’t put the book down. It is after this point that a second main character is introduced quite late in the book, and it just gets better from there. </p><p>I do have a qualm with something that is revealed at the end of the book. To me, it is simply not believable, and I have a hard time reconciling this point with the rest of the book. I feel like I didn’t often have to suspend my disbelief while reading this book, so the fact that I had to do it at the very end is a bit disappointing.</p><p>Overall, <em>The Wolf Road</em> is a delight. I want to compare this novel to some kind of careening vehicle that’s speeding down the road out of control, but while that comparison might convey the feeling the tension in the novel imbues, it might discount the fact that this novel feels carefully executed.</p><p></p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"during-times-of-distress-i-always-return-to-mary-oliver.","data":{"title":{"text":"Contemplating collective grief through the essays of Mary Oliver"},"date":"27.08.2020","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"book-summary-app-blinkist-wants-to-address-the-market","data":{"title":{"text":"No time to read in a pandemic?
