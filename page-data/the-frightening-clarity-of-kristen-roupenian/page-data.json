The story collection is refreshing in an unusual way. I felt like I had heard many of these stories before, but never with Roupenian’s clarity.</p><p>While some stories remain firmly rooted in the real, and even the hyper-real, others are fantasy and still others blur the boundary between the real and the surreal. Roupenian has achieved a story collection that embodies perhaps my favorite aspect of short story collections, which is a common thread that invites all the stories to coexist alongside each other. She writes within a universe that is not quite shared across the stories. Rather, the common thread among them is a particular mood that is slippery to describe. The stories of <em>You Know You Want This</em> drift atop the same undercurrent that underlies the title—a directive to the reader that invites them to examine their own darkest characteristics through the lens of characters who are somehow as believable as they are ghastly.</p><p>I chose to read “Cat Person” first, even though it falls in the middle of the collection, since I had heard murmurings about its viral popularity. Throughout this story, I thought to myself, I have heard this before. I have heard this story tens of times from female friends who have gone on Tinder dates. In my opinion, the genius of “Cat Person” is that Roupenian takes this story we have all heard before in some capacity and gives it a new clarity we have not considered. In the same way that a piquant poem may capture a feeling we have experienced but not previously named, “Cat Person” takes the archetypal arc of a couple’s brief relationship and refocuses it into a manifesto of the modern female twenty-something dating experience. </p><p>Another story I will highlight is “The Good Guy.” This story follows the life of an emotionally manipulative protagonist whose decisions would seem egregious if the reader were not inside his head. Roupenian here crafts a character who allows the reader to understand the harm the “nice guy” persona can cause. “Good guy” Ted makes cringe-worthy decisions such as the decision to carry on a relationship with a girl he abhors, and Roupenian carefully crafts Ted’s justifications to allow the reader to understand his behavior. This story is akin to “Cat Person” in its novel telling of a narrative with which we are all familiar—man is horrible to woman yet vehemently defends his honor as a “nice guy.” With “The Good Guy,” Roupenian shines incriminating light on that paradoxical self-regard.</p><p>Other stories in <em>You Know You Want This</em> explore situations where passion interrogates the limits of human morality. “Bad Boy” examines a boundaries-testing sexual relationship, and “Scarred” follows a woman who discovers a book of spells that actually work, to name a few examples. These stories feel less like the right here, right now sociological exposés of “Cat Person” and “The Good Guy” and more like thought experiments that are not meant to be taken literally. Although the stories that fall into this category occasionally require the reader to suspend their disbelief, this sacrifice is ultimately worthwhile for the reader to explore Roupenian’s hypothetical realities. Yes, Roupenian seems to wink, of course this would never happen. But what if it did? </p><p>Several of Roupenian’s stories also feature child protagonists. “Look at Your Game, Girl” and “Sardines” tap into the faraway yet familiar feeling of discovering the dangers of the world during one’s childhood. Roupenian gives a dark twist to settings like sleepovers and birthday parties, allowing that foreboding undercurrent that pulses throughout the whole collection to burn through childhood’s plastic exterior. Again, the author takes familiar experiences and turns them in on themselves, implicating the reader as an accomplice in these forays of taking things too far, convincing the reader that they know they want this, meaning they are somehow responsible for the way these events unfold. The reader is uncomfortable, disgusted, sometimes horrified, yet they cannot look away, and at the end of each story, Roupenian shows us what can happen when we get what we want this time around.</p><p><em>You Know You Want This</em> is a triumphant collection that pins down the current moment and watches it squirm. I tend to prefer the encapsulating experience of a novel over the chaotic bursts of short story collections, yet this collection reminds me of the brilliance of which the short story form is capable. It is a harrowing experience that you at once want to carry close and thrust away, an emotion with fascinating complexities and unconscionable implications.</p><p></p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"during-times-of-distress-i-always-return-to-mary-oliver.","data":{"title":{"text":"Contemplating collective grief through the essays of Mary Oliver"},"date":"27.08.2020","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"book-summary-app-blinkist-wants-to-address-the-market","data":{"title":{"text":"No time to read in a pandemic?
