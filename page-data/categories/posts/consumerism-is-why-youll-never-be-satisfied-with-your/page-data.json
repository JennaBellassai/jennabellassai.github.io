At the time, I assumed I was playing too much and thought about cutting back. I also considered that my general malaise due to the pandemic was seeping into my Animal Crossing experience. The game could not be responsible for my sadness. It must have been unrelated.</p><p>However, as more weeks have passed, more ingenious custom designs and house layouts and island infrastructures have paraded through my Twitter feed, and governmental edicts have morphed from “do not gather in large groups” to “do not gather” to “do not leave your home unless absolutely necessary,” I am beginning to pinpoint why Animal Crossing has soured for me.</p><p>It started with the DIY projects. The last Animal Crossing game I played before this one was Animal Crossing: City Folk for the Wii. In the Wii game, there was no crafting of any sort. The Animal Crossing I was accustomed to was one where you were at the mercy of random events in the game to collect furniture, none of which you could customize at all. In New Horizons, as Tom Nook explained how my character could use materials collected on the island to craft pieces of furniture from scratch, I was awed. The possibilities seemed endless.</p><p>I quickly set to work on crafting every DIY recipe my character could get her hands on. I scoured my island for materials, then when my island’s supply ran short, I scoured the nameless, randomly generated islands you can visit via Dodo Airlines. Every time I received a new recipe, I was quick to favorite it so that I wouldn’t forget to craft it. </p><p>Then came customization. Again, I was astounded at how the franchise had evolved since I last played the game. Not only could I craft my own furniture, I could customize it in different shades or my own custom designs? </p><p>This was not the Animal Crossing I knew. In the Animal Crossing I knew, there was so little to do that you had to make up your own goals to keep the game interesting. I remember reading bad reviews for old versions of the game that all had the same central sentiment: there’s not enough to do. At the time, I felt that the fact that I enjoyed the game meant that there was something scrappy about me. I had the discipline required to make the game fun. </p><p>In this new Animal Crossing, I realized, there is too much to do, and there are too many people watching. The endless configurations of customization possible in the game are dizzying. The other dimension of this is that seeing screenshots of other people’s Animal Crossing islands makes me envious. My efforts in the game are never finished. My character’s house, my island, my town are never enough. </p><p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons encapsulates the endless gnawing of consumerism more than any of its predecessors. What was this displaced discomfort I felt with the monumental selection of items in the game? It was a similar discomfort I felt when viewing Instagram ads, that seed of insecurity that consumerism plants and refuses to stop nurturing. It’s that feeling that you never have enough, that someone has a more thoughtfully curated collection of possessions than you, that until you buy that <em>one more thing</em> you will be unsatisfied.</p><p>This exists in contrast to our current real world, one in which we must scrutinize our consumption more than ever. Upper middle class people now face a dilemma they may never have experienced before, but that working class people know intimately: how long can we go without buying groceries? How little can we get away with buying online? How can we make the most of what we already have?</p><p>Every decision we make in our daily lives now requires a new level of moral scrutiny. The scores of people in the U.S. who are newly unemployed have been thrust into a financial reality that makes this cramped, isolated life feel even more suffocating. The categories of consumption to which privileged people like me never gave a second thought now give us pause. Items that people of financial means took for granted are now sold out in every store. Surplus feels like a distant dream.</p><p>Unless, of course, you’re playing Animal Crossing. There, surplus reigns supreme. The Animal Crossing homes and landscapes racking up the retweets are not the most ascetic. They’re lavish, excessive, meticulously curated. They imply that if you continue to collect material things, even if they are virtual, you will be rewarded.</p><p>Consumerism’s siren song is nothing new. We have learned to compare ourselves to our peers and to constantly compete to consume. However, the pandemic has defamiliarized this urge to the point where it seems more egregious than before. Animal Crossing: New Horizons allows us to mobilize the consumerism we now cannot in good moral standing enact in real life. The game has taken in our evicted yearning to buy and given it a place to sleep.</p><p>I’m nostalgic for the old Animal Crossing for the most common reason it was criticized: there wasn’t enough to do. At some point, you had all the furniture. There was a tangible end. The Internet was flighty enough that your friends might never see the world you created. You ran out of things to buy. That was a relief.</p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"tech-alone-cant-fix-ais-bias-problem-nist-reports","data":{"title":{"text":"Tech alone can’t fix AI’s bias problem, NIST reports"},"date":"30.03.2022","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"will-openais-code-generation-model-revolutionize-labor","data":{"title":{"text":"Will OpenAI’s code generation model revolutionize labor?
