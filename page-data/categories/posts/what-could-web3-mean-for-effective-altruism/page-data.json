Then, NFTs. Now, Web 3.0, or more simply, Web3. What is it, and what implications does it hold for effective altruism and philanthropy more broadly?</p><p></p><p>Web3 is a <a  href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/web3-gavin-wood-interview/\">decentralized online ecosystem built on the blockchain.</a> “<a  href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2022/01/24/what-is-web3-all-about-an-easy-explanation-with-examples/?sh=3cf555b62255\">Decentralized</a>” means that the architecture to support Web3 technologies is distributed across many computers, so no single central entity has control over it.</p><p></p><p>Scott Smith and Lina Srivastava <a  href=\"https://ssir.org/articles/entry/web3_and_the_trap_of_for_good\">wrote</a> in Stanford Social Innovation Review that Web3 is “an umbrella term for a panoply of decentralized models, protocols, and technologies–blockchains, DeFi (decentralized finance), NFTs, crypto coins, and more.” In other words, Web3 is a catchall term for all of the decentralized technologies making headlines today.</p><p></p><p><a  href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/nft-sales-hit-25-billion-2021-growth-shows-signs-slowing-2022-01-10/#:~:text=NFT%20sales%20volume%20totalled%20%2424.9,record%20who%20owns%20the%20NFT.&amp;text=Estimates%20of%20volumes%20vary%20by,depending%20on%20what%20is%20included.\">Reuters reported</a> that NFT sales hit $25 billion in 2021. As of September 2021, 16% of Americans had invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrency, according to a <a  href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/11/16-of-americans-say-they-have-ever-invested-in-traded-or-used-cryptocurrency/\">Pew Research Center survey</a>. As decentralized technologies become more popular, proponents of the effective altruism may wonder where these technologies fit into the movement.</p><p></p><p>Effective altruism <a  href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/15/17924288/future-perfect-explained\">professes</a> that we should all try to do the most good we can in the most effective ways possible. Tenets of effective altruism include donating a significant portion of one’s income and <a  href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/8/24/23318033/effective-altruism-longtermism-givewell-will-macaskill\">considering the long term</a> through methods such as <a  href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2021/11/3/22760718/patient-philanthropy-fund-charity-longtermism\">investing to give.</a> If Web3 is the future, how should philanthropists invested in the long term think about it now?</p><p></p><p>In cases of humanitarian crises like the one in Venezuela in 2019, cryptocurrency transactions can <a  href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/10/18700235/cryptocurrency-venezuela-humanitarian-aid-maduro-bitcoin\">skirt pitfalls in aid delivery</a> to which traditional donations are susceptible. Cryptocurrency also allows friends and family far away from the crisis to send remittances without the exorbitant fees associated with wire transfers. Given this added efficiency, cryptocurrency aid appears to be aligned with effective altruism’s pursuit of giving in the most efficient way possible.</p><p></p><p>Organizations have used Web3 technologies for other philanthropic initiatives aside from crisis relief efforts. For example, UNICEF <a  href=\"https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicef-launch-uns-largest-ever-nft-collection-mark-75th-anniversary\">sold one thousand NFTs</a> as part of an initiative called Giga to make sure schools in underserved communities had Internet connections. According to Giga co-founder Chris Fabian, as <a  href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-philanthropy-demonstrates-new-ways-of-giving-back\">reported by Cointelegraph</a>, “using NFT proceeds has allowed Giga to bring in a new community of donors seeking social good opportunities through cryptocurrency.”</p><p></p><p>In addition to cryptocurrency and NFTs, there are also DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations. A <a  href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-new-philanthropic-frontier-how-web3-could-democratize-donations\">nonprofit structured as a DAO</a> could theoretically allow for the nonprofit’s decision-making to be completely decentralized. DAO members would use tokens to vote on organization decisions captured in a smart contract hosted on a blockchain.</p><p></p><p>However, there are many critics of Web3. A prominent critique is that Web3 is a new example of techno-solutionism, <a  href=\"https://lab.cccb.org/en/against-complexity/\">the belief in a simple technological solution to society’s complex problems.</a></p><p></p><p>According to <a  href=\"https://ssir.org/articles/entry/web3_and_the_trap_of_for_good\">Smith and Srivastava</a>, “Web3 is being represented as a means of wresting control away from corrupt or malign political interests held by the techno-dominant. But there is nothing inherently magical about Web3.” Despite claims that Web3’s decentralization means shared ownership of web infrastructure, the wealthy and corporations currently dominate ownership. Smith and Srivastava write that Web3 reproduces power imbalances of technologies before it, and the appeal of decentralization is not enough to counteract those imbalances.</p><p></p><p>Elizabeth M. Renieris <a  href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/articles/amid-the-hype-over-web3-informed-skepticism-is-critical/\">criticizes</a> the ethos around Web3 “characterized by free speech absolutism and free market ideals” and cites numerous harms it has enabled, including racism, harassment, and hate speech. She points to an <a  href=\"https://www.inputmag.com/culture/george-floyd-nfts-floydies-racism\">NFT project</a> on OpenSea that co-opted the image of George Floyd in offensive caricatures. “Without a critical perspective, familiar harms will not only be replicated; they will be exacerbated,” Renieris writes.</p><p></p><p>Renieris also <a  href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/articles/amid-the-hype-over-web3-informed-skepticism-is-critical/\">points out</a> that critics of Web3 are often told that if they don’t like it, they should build something better. In response, she claims that criticism requires addressing issues’ root causes instead of building what amounts to a cosmetic solution. “Computational or technological attempts to ‘decentralize’ power without addressing the social, political and economic enablers of concentrated power and wealth, such as decades of <a  href=\"https://prospect.org/power/how-neoliberal-policy-shaped-internet-surveillance-monopoly/\">neo-liberal policies</a> predicated on the illusion of individual choice and control, are bound to fail,” she writes.</p><p></p><p>In addition to providing a platform for hate speech and reproducing unjust power structures, decentralized technologies require a significant amount of energy to support their infrastructures. As of this writing, the Ethereum network is <a  href=\"https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption\">consuming</a> an annualized 77 terawatt-hours of energy, about the same amount as the country of Chile. </p><p></p><p>Philanthropic efforts to use Web3 technologies have met backlash due to their environmental impact. The World Wildlife Federation-UK <a  href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923530/world-wildlife-fund-nft-polygon-layer-2-blockchain-energy-emissions\">ran a campaign</a> earlier this year to use the proceeds from selling NFTs to protect endangered species. The organization used Polygon, a blockchain that is supposedly more energy-efficient, but critics <a  href=\"https://digiconomist.net/the-carbon-footprint-of-polygon/\">pointed out</a> that it relies on the Ethereum network. Including that relationship when calculating Polygon’s carbon footprint means its carbon emissions greatly exceed the WWF’s estimate. WWF <a  href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/wwfs-statement-about-nfts-trial\">ended the campaign</a> two days after it started in response to the backlash.</p><p></p><p>Web3 technologies have already been mobilized to help people in need, but their entanglement in social and environmental issues complicates their potential role in effective altruism. Just as direct cash transfers can have <a  href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers#Whatarethepotentialdownsidesoftheintervention\">potential negative adverse effects</a>, direct cryptocurrency transactions to those in need are not a panacea. Evgeny Morozov, author of “To Save Everything, Click Here” and a critic of techno-solutionism, cautions that the urgency of societal issues does not automatically confer legitimacy on the newest technology available to tackle those issues. This thinking is in line with effective altruism’s advocacy for long-term outcomes–though Web3 is already here and provides some efficient ways to give, deliberation is necessary to do so in a way that minimizes negative effects.</p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"how-is-the-pandemic-changing-how-we-think-about-business","data":{"title":{"text":"How is the pandemic changing how we think about business recovery from disasters?"},"date":"26.08.2022","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"exploring-u.s.-college-graduation-rate-statistics","data":{"title":{"text":"Exploring U.S. College Graduation Rate Statistics"},"date":"18.07.2022","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"uid":"what-could-web3-mean-for-effective-altruism"}},"staticQueryHashes":["23265376","3257754404"]}
