This is the second collection of hers to be published posthumously. I really enjoyed the first, called <em>A Manual for Cleaning Women</em>, so I was excited to read this new selection of stories.</p><p>I find myself marveling at Berlin’s unique style in this form. Her stories are unlike any other short stories I’ve read recently. Berlin will not hesitate to drop you into a world with no introduction or exposition, complete with slang and specific terminology unique to that world. It can feel disorienting, but it also makes the form more lightweight. You don’t have to slog through a chunk of exposition every time you start a new story.</p><p>Something else particular to Berlin is how she rarely makes the plot the star of the story. Unlike Kristen Roupenian, who writes stories where plot-driven tension builds to a climax, Berlin sometimes writes a story where very little happens at all. A decent number of the stories in this collection have no discernible plot arc. Sometimes, we just get to see one scene. Although it takes some getting used to, there’s something to be said for the way Berlin can craft a successful story with almost no plot.</p><p>I’ve been trying to wrap my mind around how she does it, and my current theory is that Berlin’s world-building is cumulative in this collection. Perhaps my favorite thing about this collection is that even though the stories exist as discrete entities, Berlin uses certain characters and motifs across stories over and over again in different ways each time. As you progress through this collection, each time you start a story, you feel less disoriented, as Berlin will slip in a version of a character you’ve already seen before or a familiar setting. Reading this collection is like watching a series of one-act plays where the same actors and set pieces play different roles in each one. </p><p>Even though the stories have these little references to each other, Berlin’s world is far from narrow. The stories span continents, some taking place in Texas, Paris, Chile, California, and more. Some stories take place in the 40’s, others the 50’s, and still others the late 70’s. Reading Berlin’s collection (and the note on her life at the end), I felt like I was touring all the eras and locales she experienced throughout her life. </p><p>My favorite story in this collection is “Andado: A Gothic Romance,” the story of a teenage girl who spends four days at the estate of one of the wealthiest men in Chile, Don Andrés, a family friend. During her stay, she spends time with the Don Andrés’s family and learns his eldest son is having an affair with the housekeeper. This story has the depth of a novel with the brevity of a short story; to me, it feels like the pièce de résistance of this collection.</p><p>Several other stories stand out to me as highlights. “Lead Street, Alburqueque” follows an up-and-coming artist named Rex and the woman he marries, a seventeen-year-old girl from South America named Maria. Maria is determined to please Rex, but even after the birth of their child, Rex is restless and relentless in his endeavor to make it big. </p><p>“La Barca de la Ilusión” is about a rich family living in Yelapa, Mexico. The father, Buzz, is a recovering heroin addict, and when Maya, the mother, encounters an old dealer who used to sell to her husband, she is determined to do whatever it takes to prevent her husband from relapsing.</p><p>There are many other stories I enjoyed in <em>Evening in Paradise</em>, including the story of a stay-at-home mother haunted by the routine of her day-to-day, a story about a meeting between two women who were each married to the same man at different points in time, and a story about a woman grieving the death of her friend who considers everyone a suspect in her friend’s murder. </p><p>While each story can stand alone, reading this collection in its entirety is a special experience. If you prefer for short stories to have clear plot arcs, or you like more exposition to fully understand what’s going on in a story, you may not like Berlin’s work. However, if you’re on the fence, I would encourage you to first read one or two of the stories I mention above. I don’t quite know how she does it, but Berlin has a way of sucking you into her world, and one story might be enough to get you hooked.</p>"}}},{"__typename":"PrismicPostBodyCodeBlock","slice_type":"code_block","id":"Prismic__PostBodyCodeBlock__Prismic__Post__XkskZxMAACIAzm9Q__body__2","primary":{"code_block":{"html":"<pre>test code block</pre>"}}},{"__typename":"PrismicPostBodyQuote","slice_type":"quote","id":"Prismic__PostBodyQuote__Prismic__Post__XkskZxMAACIAzm9Q__body__3","primary":{"quote":{"html":"<p>test quote</p>","text":"test quote"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"tech-alone-cant-fix-ais-bias-problem-nist-reports","data":{"title":{"text":"Tech alone can’t fix AI’s bias problem, NIST reports"},"date":"30.03.2022","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"will-openais-code-generation-model-revolutionize-labor","data":{"title":{"text":"Will OpenAI’s code generation model revolutionize labor?
