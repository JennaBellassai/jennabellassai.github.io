My confusion could come from the fact that the book instilled in me a sense of foreboding and general disgust, and it is sometimes hard to recognize that as an indicator of brilliance. My confusion could also have to do with the protagonist, whose neuroses are at times ultra-relatable and at times utterly revolting. A third potential explanation could be that the book feels too long to be a novella but lacks the depth of plot you would expect from a novel.</p><p>Eileen is a hard character to wrap your mind around. On one hand, she exhibits some characteristics typical of almost anyone in their early 20’s: she is obsessed with her physical appearance and convinced everyone is constantly thinking about her. She holds a ridiculous crush on a coworker and spends a lot of time fantasizing about him as well as a good deal of time fantasizing about escaping the New England seaside town where she grew up. She had a rough childhood and is grieving the death of her mother while living with her delusional alcoholic father. She is stuck in limbo between clinging to her remaining living parent and running away to start a life of her own.</p><p>However, Eileen exhibits some attitudes and behaviors that range from unnerving to detestable. She keeps a frozen dead mouse in the glove compartment of her car and checks on it every once in a while. She sleeps in the attic of her parents’ house and occasionally pees in a jar to avoid going downstairs to go to the bathroom. She eats a doughnut then wipes her mouth on a scarf at a store she does not intend to buy. These behaviors make you want to despise Eileen; she is, in a lot of ways, contemptible.</p><p>I find Eileen’s character to be one of the strongest aspects of the book. Moshfegh crafts a character you want to hate unconditionally, but you cannot help but relate to her all the while. At some points, you sympathize with Eileen, then she does something so vile that you are repulsed with yourself for having felt bad for her. You see Eileen crying in bed with her dead mother, but you also see her spying on a boy touching himself at the prison where she works.</p><p>That said, there were a few times I had to suspend my disbelief regarding Eileen. At the beginning of the book, Eileen explains that she hates her bodily functions and can’t stand to imagine others being aware of them. Later on, Eileen admits that she will go without showering for many days at a time just to stew in her own filth. These two details seemed to be at odds to me, and I couldn’t ignore it. How could someone so unhealthily obsessed with her appearance stand to go days and days without showering? For the most part, the conflicting aspects of Eileen’s character end up complementing each other, but this detail was hard to justify.</p><p>I do think it was a strong choice from Moshfegh for the story to be told from the perspective of Eileen when she is in her fifties. Fifty-year-old Eileen’s musings on her silly habits and obsessions in her younger days ground the reader in reality: okay, even she realizes she was being ridiculous thirty years ago.</p><p>As far as the other characters go, I found Eileen’s father to be more or less the archetypal drunken father character. I cannot remember any moments from the book where he surprised me, and maybe this is intentional. Rebecca, the mysterious woman who begins working at the prison with Eileen, is a bit more interesting, but there seems to be an aspect of Rebecca that is never revealed to the reader.</p><p>My main qualm with this book is its plot. The jacket and the beginning of the book position it well; the story follows the days before Christmas before Eileen leaves her hometown, and there is some shocking event that occurs. My issue is that most of the book feels like filler. That’s not to say that scenes where Eileen is at home or working at the prison aren’t well written and interesting to read, but many of them do nothing to advance the plot. Rebecca only arrives on the scene about halfway through the book, and it seems to me that Rebecca’s arrival is the inciting incident for the main action. Then, the shocking event alluded to by the book jacket finally occurs in the final one hundred pages or so. I will say that I didn’t predict the twist, but by the time it arrived I felt so fatigued from anticipating it that it failed to land with the shock value that it probably deserved. For much of the time I was reading this book, I felt like Eileen, planning and plotting for something drastic to happen, but just waiting in the meantime.</p><p>A secondary qualm I have is that the book flirts with some themes it doesn’t end up fully addressing. For example, Rebecca is bothered by the case of a one particular boy in the prison. Moral ambiguity surrounds the boy’s story and Rebecca’s response to it, yet Moshfegh doesn’t explore that ambiguity as much as she could have. I found myself wishing that the portions of the book that follow Eileen around her daily life would engage more with some of the deeper themes Moshfegh brings up occasionally. On the other end of the spectrum, there is a moment that was too much for me when Eileen wraps a bottle of wine in a blanket she stole from the baby Jesus in a nativity scene. At a point like that, it feels like Moshfegh is reaching too hard for a metaphorical moment. My feeling by the end of the book was that I had read a novel that was mostly exposition.</p><p>My indecision about whether or not I like this book is shaped by the fact that there are many viscerally gross moments. It’s hard to enjoy reading about the decrepit, filthy, moldy, rotting house where Eileen and her father live, yet the description keeps me engaged and makes Eileen’s predicament seem more real. It’s also hard to stomach the moments in the book when Eileen is sick or takes laxatives. I will conclude by saying that, although the book can be difficult to read at times, it is ultimately a fascinating look at the life of a disturbed protagonist, and it’s worth your time if only for Moshfegh’s admirable character development and description.</p><p></p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"tech-alone-cant-fix-ais-bias-problem-nist-reports","data":{"title":{"text":"Tech alone can’t fix AI’s bias problem, NIST reports"},"date":"30.03.2022","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"will-openais-code-generation-model-revolutionize-labor","data":{"title":{"text":"Will OpenAI’s code generation model revolutionize labor?
