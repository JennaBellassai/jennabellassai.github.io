The story opens to show the aftermath of a devastating house fire that destroys the Richardson family home. The rest of the novel is the story of the events leading up to the fire.</p><p>The reader learns that the Richardsons are an affluent white family with four high school age children living in Shaker Heights, Ohio. While the Richardsons’ origin story is quite ordinary, their tenants’ background is less clear. Mia and Pearl Warren arrived in Shaker Heights after moving every year of Pearl’s childhood, never staying in one place for very long. Mia promises Pearl that Shaker will be different—they will stay there for a long time. With this in mind, Pearl befriends Moody Richardson, and soon enough she befriends the rest of the Richardson children and begins to spend time with them at their house. As Pearl discovers what it is like for the Richardson children to grow up in a rich family and the Richardsons learn about Pearl’s nontraditional upbringing, alliances and tensions form. When both families get involved in a controversial local court case, characters’ relationships with each other come into question along with their beliefs.</p><p>Summarizing this novel in one paragraph feels disingenuous, since so much happens among so many people in it. Ng has performed an admirable feat by creating a story that feels unified despite the vast number of characters and events it follows. She carefully connects the many concurrent events of the novel by uniting them under several thematic threads. The result is a rich investigation of the consequences of affluent suburban life, the implications of idealizing a traditional family structure, and the meaning of knowing who you are and where you come from.</p><p>One thread Ng explores is the idea that any circumstance has layers of ambiguity; a choice is rarely all right or all wrong. No character in <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> is a villain, not even the arsonist. Although the Warrens and the Richardsons all show moments of weakness (and some of them even do horrible things), Ng always gives the reader a justification for their behavior. She doesn’t excuse characters’ wrongdoings, but she instead frames the events so that the reader will understand what led the character to make the choice they did. </p><p>Characters repeatedly muse that Shaker Heights is the kind of place where nothing ever happens. People leave their doors unlocked because they believe the community is so safe. Although the suburb might appear placid, plenty of shocking events occur in this novel, and Ng writes it in such a way that doesn’t feel contrived. Though she plays into the archetype of a small town with big trouble brewing underneath the surface, the nuance she commands prevents the events of the story from coming across as melodramatic.</p><p>Ng also deftly navigates the theme of racial tension surrounding the court case that has captured local attention. The case involves a Chinese woman seeking to regain custody of the baby she abandoned who was adopted by a white couple. This woman works at a restaurant with Mia, and Mr. Richardson is the lawyer who represents the white couple. The reader gets to learn every character’s stance on this case, and Ng thus invites the reader to question whether one family structure is better than another and to consider the impact of being raised by white parents on a child of color.</p><p>An especially prominent idea Ng explores in this novel is what happens when people disagree about the best way to build a life and raise a child. Hearing from the Richardsons’, Mia, and Pearl in turn, the reader sees how each parent believes they are doing best by their children, and each child holds a different belief about if they have been successful or not. Upon observing Mia and Pearl’s ascetic, untethered way of living, Mrs. Richardson must interrogate the luxurious and firmly rooted lifestyle she’s cultivated for years. When Mia observes Pearl making friends with the Richardson children and feeling at home in their enormous house, Mia wonders if she has deprived her child by working as an artist and barely making ends meet. Ng has achieved something spectacular by encouraging the reader to examine the choices they have made in their life just as the Richardsons and Warrens examine theirs.</p><p>I would highly recommend this novel if you are looking to ponder these themes. I include that condition because this book is certainly not a beach read; though the book is enjoyable, the subject matter is serious, and there are some pretty dark moments. Ng’s stellar characterization and meticulous interweaving plotlines make you fly through the pages and regret that you can’t spend more time with its characters after the end. Do not get the impression that the events of this book are those of a soap opera; they are a fascinating series of case studies on a set of intriguing and relevant topics. If you are interested in the moral implications of suburban life, affluence, and nontraditional families, you simply must read this book.</p><p></p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"how-is-the-pandemic-changing-how-we-think-about-business","data":{"title":{"text":"How is the pandemic changing how we think about business recovery from disasters?"},"date":"26.08.2022","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"exploring-u.s.-college-graduation-rate-statistics","data":{"title":{"text":"Exploring U.S. College Graduation Rate Statistics"},"date":"18.07.2022","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"uid":"little-fires-everywhere-by-celeste-ng-is-a-triumphant"}},"staticQueryHashes":["23265376","3257754404"]}
