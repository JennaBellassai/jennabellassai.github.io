The book is <em>Trust Exercise</em> by Susan Choi. If you have ever studied theater, or if you enjoy books where every sentence feels meticulously pruned to perfection, or if you like thinking about the nature of trust, this book is definitely for you.</p><p><em>Trust Exercise</em> is about two teenagers studying theater at a performing arts high school in 1982 in a sprawling, unnamed southern city. Sarah and David’s first romantic encounter takes place in the classroom during one of their eccentric teacher’s trust exercises. They then attempt to navigate a romance in the summer between their freshman and sophomore years and have a falling out. As Sarah and David go through their sophomore year, they develop a resentment for each other that their theater teacher attempts to capitalize upon for the sake of the Art. Through all of this, Sarah is in constant conflict with her mother over Sarah’s desperate desire for a car. The sophomore class hosts a group of visiting students from Britain, which introduces new social stresses.</p><p>That is all the plot summary I’ll give for now because something happens about two thirds of the way through the book that I don’t want to spoil. I will warn you right now that I have not told you the whole story of what is going on in <em>Trust Exercise.</em></p><p>As far as why I found this book so enjoyable, I’ll begin with the aspect that struck me first—Choi’s fabulous use of language. Her figurative language is especially inventive, and she’s constantly dropping metaphors that seem crisp in their freshness but give you the feeling you know exactly what she’s talking about. </p><p>Though you need the context of Choi’s purposefully meandering paragraphs to marvel the way I did, I’ll give you a few examples anyway:</p>"}}},{"__typename":"PrismicPostBodyQuote","slice_type":"quote","id":"Prismic__PostBodyQuote__Prismic__Post__XojhyBAAAB8AEHLe__body__2","primary":{"quote":{"html":"<p>He felt skewered by lust and as if he could hang there, afloat on the pain.</p>","text":"He felt skewered by lust and as if he could hang there, afloat on the pain."}}},{"__typename":"PrismicPostBodyText","slice_type":"text","id":"Prismic__PostBodyText__Prismic__Post__XojhyBAAAB8AEHLe__body__3","primary":{"text":{"html":"<p>When a character sees a neglected sewing kit stashed in a desk in a stage set: </p>"}}},{"__typename":"PrismicPostBodyQuote","slice_type":"quote","id":"Prismic__PostBodyQuote__Prismic__Post__XojhyBAAAB8AEHLe__body__4","primary":{"quote":{"html":"<p>It seemed like her own lonely, unloved competence hidden in that scratched plastic box.</p>","text":"It seemed like her own lonely, unloved competence hidden in that scratched plastic box."}}},{"__typename":"PrismicPostBodyQuote","slice_type":"quote","id":"Prismic__PostBodyQuote__Prismic__Post__XojhyBAAAB8AEHLe__body__5","primary":{"quote":{"html":"<p>He seemed to have to bend his voice into the phone the way a giant might bend his head through a doorframe.</p>","text":"He seemed to have to bend his voice into the phone the way a giant might bend his head through a doorframe."}}},{"__typename":"PrismicPostBodyText","slice_type":"text","id":"Prismic__PostBodyText__Prismic__Post__XojhyBAAAB8AEHLe__body__6","primary":{"text":{"html":"<p>I would never think to describe the way someone talks on the phone as a giant bending through a doorframe, but given that comparison, I feel that, yes, I know exactly what Choi is talking about. She creates the same effect when commenting on the nature of people in this book, resulting in many moments where I felt that her succinct description of a character’s motivations was exactly right. </p><p>I suspect that my past experience doing theater in high school and taking a theater class in college enhanced my experience of reading <em>Trust Exercise</em>. The book is about theater on a surface level, following its characters through their auditions and rehearsals and performances, but the themes of the book also draw on those explored in the world of drama. The folding chairs facing all directions on the cover of the book call to mind a rehearsal room with constantly shifting chairs but also the concept of assuming a role by sitting somewhere, be it on a stage or in a classroom or holding a pen as you write a book. What does it mean to play a role? This book asks. How does that change depending on who defined the role? What if you don’t intend to play the role? I adored how seamlessly Choi integrated these questions into this novel as the same questions of lieutenancy plague the characters in their theatrical studies and personal lives.</p><p>Another theme Choi tackles is that of control, of the self and others. The students practice the Meisner technique in class, which involves two people sitting across from each other and repeating the same phrase following the impulse that the other person has sparked. While they are determined to follow their impulses instead of premeditations, they struggle to do so in front of the judgment of their peers. Similarly, off the stage, the petty alliances and rivalries of high school inform their every interaction, and they rarely act unfettered. She calls out “the anger we always feel at the person who spoils our idea of ourself.”</p><p>Though the book centers around teenagers, I would not call this a young adult novel. Infused in the narration is a sort of knowing gaze and wry smile of a much older perspective. Yes, David and Sarah are real people with real emotions, yet they are still teenagers, and Choi doesn’t let us forget this. She is careful not to dismiss their tumultuous angst outright, but there is an edge to her narration that expresses an awareness that yes, sometimes these teenagers can be a bit melodramatic. </p><p>For example, Sarah is obsessed with learning to drive and getting her own car. She laments “the utter dispossession of not being licensed to drive in that city of cars. It was part of the excruciating in-betweenness of no longer being children, yet lacking those powers enjoyed by adults.” So Choi recognizes Sarah’s struggle to feel in control of her life when she cannot control her own transport, yet she grants permission to the reader to laugh at how ridiculous it is when David walks down a highway median “in the heat of the damned” to meet up with Sarah in secret. </p><p>When the students go back to school for their sophomore year, Choi writes, “They took the natural ambition, at that age, to shock the peer group with a summer metamorphosis to greater extremes, being actors.” Here she plays the role of outside observer who is familiar with the strange behaviors of her subjects yet regards herself as superior.</p><p>Choi’s choice to write about teenagers is very in line with the themes she explores in this novel. She is interested in the moment of adolescence when teenagers realize that they can exist beyond the boundaries their parents and supervisors have erected: “Freedom, selfhood—those intangibles they might have once thought were reserved for adults—turn out to be already theirs.” Just as the students are learning to assume roles of characters unlike themselves on the stage, they are learning that they have the power to step into and out of roles in their own lives. At one point, the dance teacher says to Sarah, “Young people like you experience pain more intensely than those of us just a bit older...That is why developing your talent at this age is so crucial. This heightened emotional pain is a gift.” I wonder if, for just this brief moment, Choi is speaking through the dance teacher to express why she has chosen to tell this story through the lives of teenagers. Given the themes Choi is exploring in this novel of selfhood, impersonation, control, trust, and the question of whether one can truly know another, it makes perfect sense for the book to be about adolescence.</p><p>To characterize this book as young adult would be severely misguided for additional reasons I cannot list here without spoiling it.</p><p>Speaking of spoiling it (which I still will not do, don’t worry), the twist in this book really came out of nowhere for me. I was reading this book in ebook form, which may account for some of my bewilderment, since an error in the page count and progress calculation made it seem like I had finished the book when there was really quite a bit left. I don’t want to say too much for fear of giving things away, but suffice it to say that reading this book is a trust exercise. I’ll leave you to ponder what that might mean.</p><p>I think this book is a triumph in capturing certain aspects of the human condition. To the extent that Choi’s observations feel accurate, they are also sad. There were many moments when I felt that the reasoning behind a character’s behavior was exactly right, and the fact that it was exactly right was horribly upsetting. I oscillated between marveling at Choi’s mastery of the craft and bemoaning the implications she presents for human relationships. If you’re seeking the satisfaction of an author getting it right, I would highly recommend this book, but with the caveat that Choi’s getting it right means she does not sugarcoat the reality of how we treat each other.</p>"}}}]}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"uid":"tech-alone-cant-fix-ais-bias-problem-nist-reports","data":{"title":{"text":"Tech alone can’t fix AI’s bias problem, NIST reports"},"date":"30.03.2022","categories":[{"category":{"document":[{"data":{"name":"Posts"}}]}}]}},{"uid":"will-openais-code-generation-model-revolutionize-labor","data":{"title":{"text":"Will OpenAI’s code generation model revolutionize labor?
