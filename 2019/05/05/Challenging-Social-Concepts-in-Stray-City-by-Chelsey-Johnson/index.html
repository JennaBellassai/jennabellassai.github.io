<p><em>Stray City</em> is the captivating story of Andrea Morales, a woman in her mid-twenties living in Portland, Oregon in the late 90’s. After dropping out of college, she does letterpress, supports friends’ bands, works at an antiques shop, and is a activist member of a secret organization called the Lesbian Mafia. After a hard break-up, Andrea builds a friendship with Ryan, a straight guy drummer who cuts hair. One thing leads to another, and despite the fact that Andrea is not attracted to Ryan, she falls pregnant. Though she has almost no money, she decides to keep the baby. </p>
<p>Andrea’s friends are gold star lesbians who read books like <em>The New Fuck You</em> and have no straight male friends. When Andrea reveals that she is pregnant, her friends cannot believe it. She thinks, “You know who I am. You are who I am. But what if they no longer believed me?” Andrea’s sexuality is a huge part of her identity, and she never questions her sexuality. However, her friends don’t know how to reconcile the fact that she is pregnant with all that they know about her as a person. </p>
<p>Johnson imbues her story with queer theory without getting didactic. She explores questions such as who gets to call themselves a lesbian and the relationship between sexual attraction and platonic love. Andrea has a confrontation with Jade, the lead organizer of the Lesbian Mafia. Jade says,” If the Lesbian Mafia weren’t clearly lesbians, then who could you count on to be one? Words had to mean something.” Johnson seamlessly includes investigations into semiotics and the complicated social nature of signifier and signified in Andrea’s narrative. Despite these intellectual aspects, the reader never feels that Andrea is under a microscope. </p>
<p>Johnson invites the reader to consider an unconventional sexual relationship and observe its social repercussions, constructing Andrea’s relationship with Ryan very carefully. Though Andrea is not attracted to him, she feels something like love for him, and though Ryan knows Andrea is gay, he is hurt when she doesn’t consider their relationship to be real in the way that he does. The author never cuts corners to make her narrative more digestible. Instead, she challenges the reader to consider the incredible complications of social concepts we often write off as straightforward.</p>
<p>In addition to grounding her novel in theoretical context, Johnson sets her story unambiguously in the late nineties. Throughout Andrea’s story, we get to hear about her childhood in Nebraska and how she evolved when she moved to Portland to go to Reed. I admire the way that Johnson positions Andrea’s self-discovery in the specific cultural moment of Riot Grrrl. The reader gets to observe how, once Andrea is at Reed, she meets people who are creating the music and zines she has listened to and read secretly back home in Nebraska. Andrea finds that she gets to participate in a movement that had seemed entirely out of reach in the Midwest. This backstory gets even more interesting when we eventually meet Andrea’s daughter Lucia years later. Lucia grows up in the early age of the Internet, and Johnson weaves this cultural milieu into Lucia’s story just as deftly as she weaves Riot Grrrl into Andrea’s.</p>
<p>Stray City makes you nostalgic for the time before smartphones when you had to call someone’s landline, leave a message on their answering machine, and wait for them to call back. I marveled at how well Johnson drops the reader into this era, including tiny moments like “she was on the cordless” that make you recall the time when the fact that a phone did not have a cord was a novelty. This novel is in some ways a celebration of tangible things; Andrea hoards items from her past and calls them her “archives,” and much of the novel follows the characters strumming guitars or operating a letterpress or writing postcards or putting on records, holding objects of the time in their hands. Though this fascination with the tangible ebbs ten years later, when Lucia’s connection to the world is rooted in the vast, intangible Internet, the first clue about her father’s identity is actually her inherited guitar, which appears on the cover of one of Ryan’s band’s records. I enjoyed how the focus on tangible things allowed you to immerse yourself in the story and its cultural moment.</p>
<p>I think I should stop reading inside covers of books before I read the book itself. I’ve had several experiences recently where the book jacket set me up to have certain expectations, and the degree to which the book delivers on those expectations is questionable. The book jacket for <em>Stray City</em> explains how Andrea is a lesbian who moves to Portland from the Midwest and ends up pregnant. The pregnancy does not occur until a third of the way into the book. So, for the first third of the book, I was impatient. I felt like the plot was dragging, but I wonder if I would have felt that way had I not read the book jacket and known what was coming. </p>
<p>The book jacket also mentions how, ten years later, Andrea must field questions from her daughter about her father. That doesn’t occur until maybe the last sixth of the book. While the part that occurs ten years later is probably my favorite part of the book, I felt that I was waiting forever for it to happen. That said, the wait was worth it. Moving from 1999 to 2009 with the turn of a page, you feel like something in the story has been rehydrated; the reader gets to see how Andrea has dramatically evolved over the course of raising a child. Her daughter, who for the first third of the book only exists in the reader’s anticipation, then for the next three sixths of the book exists as a fetus, finally is a real kid with opinions and emotions in the last sixth. Johnson’s choice to tell the end of the story from mostly Lucia’s perspective lends an impressive depth to the narrative. Though I felt that the story dragged toward the middle, the end of the book is a worthy conclusion.</p>
<p>An aspect of <em>Stray City</em> I’m on the fence about is Johnson’s decision to include an epistolary element. She includes postcards, voicemail transcriptions, and emails between Ryan and Andrea. Perhaps the strangest example is letters from Ryan to Lucia that never get sent. I’m not sure how to feel about this kind of collage effect because the prose is so strong by itself. The entire first third of the book is told from Andrea’s perspective, then suddenly we get to hear from Ryan directly, which feels disorienting. I’m wondering if Johnson was trying to evoke the multimedia nature of a zine by including these; while on one hand it’s clever for the form of the novel to mirror Andrea’s archivist tendencies, on the other hand, the ratio of prose to epistolary forms in the novel feels off balance.</p>
<p>I would recommend not to be fooled by the simplistic synopsis on the inside cover—<em>Stray City</em> is a wonderfully complex and thought-provoking novel. Though the pacing feels a bit inconsistent, sticking with this book pays off as you witness Andrea’s character development. Johnson gives a fascinating take on sexuality as a component of identity and the social implications of labels as well as a delightful immersion in a specific cultural moment.</p>
