<p><em>The Atlas of Reds and Blues</em> is the saddest book I have read recently, and it is also one of the best. From the first page of the novel, the reader learns that the protagonist, who has no name other than “Mother,” has been shot by police and is bleeding out in her driveway. As Mother lays on the pavement, her life begins to flash before her eyes, setting the stage for the narrative style of the novel. Through brief vignettes out of chronological order, the reader gets to learn about Mother’s childhood, her struggles to conceive a child, her experience parenting three girls, her job as a journalist, and the daily racism she experiences as a woman of color living in an affluent white suburb in Georgia. This novel is an intimate look at a collection of moments all leading up to the police raid. These disparate moments combine to form a study of how a woman of color navigates the current events of the United States.</p>
<p>Though the novel is, as one testimonial describes it, “brutal,” Laskar’s innovative narrative form makes it hard to put down. As the protagonist lays on the ground bleeding in the present day, the reader travels with her to the memories that have shaped her life. The vignette form emulates Mother’s racing thoughts in prose. Some of the vignettes read like prose poems, others like flash fiction, and others are close to the kind of prose you’d expect in a novel. </p>
<p>Though the style can make it feel like you’re being yanked from one decade to the next and back, Laskar introduces some common threads that persist through various sections to keep you grounded. For example, she includes a nonfiction thread about the history of Barbie dolls, and she also includes vignettes that describe Mother’s experiences with Barbie dolls. There’s also a thread about Mother’s dog, Greta, and her rise to strength from an abusive past as well as the sickness to which she eventually succumbs. Another repeating theme is Mother being interrogated by a police officer who has pulled her over or by a rude white neighbor who demands to know the details of her citizenship. At the beginning of <em>The Atlas of Reds and Blues</em>, I felt a bit unmoored, but as I read more and more vignettes, I began to understand the ever-moving features that make up Mother’s world.</p>
<p>That world is one of frustration, occasional joy, anger, and existential dread. Mother must look after her three daughters alone while her husband is out of town, and he travels often. She is struggling to deal with depression and wracked with guilt for yearning to be away from her children. Mother faces racist encounters at the dry cleaner’s, at her daughter’s school, and in her own neighborhood. She gets pulled over repeatedly by the same police officer who never remembers her, though she remembers him. She is dealing with disordered eating while fielding unwelcome comments about her weight from family members. </p>
<p>Yet, between these moments, Mother finds moments of joy, when laughing at the silly things her children say or remembering how she met and fell in love with her husband. Reading this book, you get to know a woman who is fiercely devoted and adamant in her refusal to submit to any oppressor but simultaneously full of uncertainty and pain, who looks back on her life and wonders which moment of it set in motion the events that ended with her being shot by police.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful aspects of this book is how events in the distant past mirror the present. You read about Mother’s experience being bullied in school while also learning that Mother’s middle daughter is being bullied. You read that one of Mother’s family members predicted her youngest daughter would not marry when butterflies did not land on her, and the youngest daughter grows up to become a nun. There are tiny moments of strife in Mother and her husband’s marriage that hint at larger issues in the present. Laskar brilliantly uses the form she has chosen to make a statement about how the events throughout our entire lives shape us and how small injustices compound over time to cause ineradicable bitterness that sometimes flares into fury.</p>
<p>I would recommend <em>The Atlas of Reds and Blues</em> if you are in the mental state to bear the heavy emotional weight that accompanies the foreboding wisdom of this book. Laskar’s novel does not sugarcoat the hardships that Mother encounters while living and working as a woman of color in the South. It scours multiple countries and generations of Mother’s memory to find the personal moments and systemic failings that alluded to Mother’s fate, while all the while she cannot help but think “it is all her doing, her undoing that is.” </p>
